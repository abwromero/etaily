# The objective of this part of the script is to take the current time in Manila time, set the start time and end time for the previous day in Manila time,
# convert the start time and end time back to UTC, and convert these UTC datetimes to UNIX timestamp. This is the format required by OpenWeather to get data from the previous day.
