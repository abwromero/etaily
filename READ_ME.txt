Etaily Data Exercise

Overview: This project aims to answer the questions given for the etaily Data Exercise. This Git repo contains all of the answers.

1. For the first task, please see the text file sql_answers.txt.

2. For the second task, please refer to the following files: python_container_in_vscode.txt, manila_previous_day_weather_script.txt, and weather.py.
python_container_in_vscode.txt is a supplementary file for this exam, which gives instructions on how to run a Python Container in VSCode.
The second file, manila_previous_day_weather_script.py is addressed in making a script that gets previous day's data in Manila.
As of this writing, getting historical data in OpenWeather requires a subscription. This leaves the exam with the only option to get current OpenWeather data.
The code for this file is in weather.py. weather.py also includes a feature to upload OpenWeather data into an S3 bucket.

3. For the third task, please refer to 'OpenWeather Schema.png' and schema_explanation.txt.

4. For the fourth task, please refer to 'OpenWeather Cloud Architecture.png' and cloud_architecture_explanation.txt.


Response to optional questions:
1. What do you think about this test?
    - The test fits well for the job description. It more or less allows a test taker to see if he or she is a fit to the role. Moreover, it also gives a glimpse of what
    the hired candidate will do.
2. Did it have a good distribution of tasks from different areas?
    - The distribution is pretty much balanced in different areas. My guess is that the candidate can figure out where he or she can improve on depending on the
    task that takes a longer time to complete.
3. Did we miss something important?
    - It lacks ETL, but the SQL part of this exam might already give a good idea of the candidate's competency in this aspect.
    - It might be a good exam alternative as well to give situational questions and let the exam taker give a feedback of what should be done. 
4. Did it have a reasonable difficulty for an online coding test?
    - The difficulty is actually reasonable. It's reasonable in a sense that a good answer can be given easily, but it will take some difficulty to give a great or
    memorable answer.
5. Any other comments?
    - I had fun taking this exam! This is much more fun than the other data-related exams from other employers.
